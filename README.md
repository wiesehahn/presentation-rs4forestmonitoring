#### Abstract

Forests in Germany are currently facing major challenges. On the one hand, conditions are changing, primarily as a result of climate change, while on the other hand the demands on forests are increasing. As a result, there is an increasing need for information on the conditions in the forest. Current terrestrial monitoring systems are an important source of information, but remote sensing data can provide important additional information. Challenges and potentials of remote sensing for forest monitoring are discussed.
